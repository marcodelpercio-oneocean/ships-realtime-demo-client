# ShipRealtime

This is a simple demo project using Rxjs Websocket Subject in order to run real-time updates of vessels positions/data on a Mapbox GL map. 
The project requires its server-side counterpart to work (See (ships-realtime-demo-server)[https://github.com/marcodelpercio-oneocean/ships-realtime-demo-server]).
The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Before you run: ng serve

Don't forget to install all node dependencies by running  `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
